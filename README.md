#  Task 3

>In this Repository, I have completed the task and saved it in a different folder. Additionally, I have taken a screenshot of the output and saved it in the **output** folder within the repository.

 

1. **Comparing JSON Objects without Considering Order of Properties**:
The code uses the Object.keys() method to get an array of keys (property names) from each object. It then checks if the lengths of the two arrays are the same. If the lengths are different, the objects are not equal. Otherwise, it uses a for...in loop to iterate over the keys of the first object. For each key, it checks if the value of the property in the first object is equal to the value of the property in the second object. If any property has a different value, the objects are not equal. Otherwise, the objects are equal.



2. **Displaying Country Flags from Rest Countries API**:
You can use the Rest Countries API URL "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all" to fetch the data and then display all the country flags in the console.


3. **Displaying Country Names, Regions, Sub-regions, and Populations from Rest Countries API**:
You can use the same Rest Countries API URL "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all" to fetch the data and then print all countries' names, regions, sub-regions, and populations.
